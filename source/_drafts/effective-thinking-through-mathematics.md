## Week 1 - The Meanie Genie
We learned how to apply the five principles that are the core of the course. Those concepts are:

- **Understand Deeply**: Before jumping into problem-solving mode, it's important to try to understand the question deeply. What was important? What wasn't important? What do you know? What don't you know? Rock-solid understanding is the foundation for success.

- **Make Mistakes**: Mistakes are great teachers. They can show you which way to turn next, and they ignite your imagination and leads you to success.

- **Raise Questions**: Ideas are in the air - the right questions will bring them out and help you see connections that otherwise would have been invisible.

- **Follow the Flow of Ideas**: Following the consequences of small ideas can result in big payoffs.

- **The Quintessential Element**: You can always improve, grow, and extract more out of your education, yourself, and the way you live your life. Change is the universal constant that allows you to get the most out of living and learning.

We also learned that we must **systematically list all the possibilities to resolve a problem**. Ask to yourself, "what are all the possibilities?".

List all possibilities, including those ones that we are going to eventually discard, because even discarding a trivial example, we have to articulate why it is a poor original decision.
